/**
 * Vite plugin to inject the Discord proxy patch script into the index.html.
 *
 * In development, the script loads synchronously to ensure patch is applied before Vite's HMR runs.
 * In production, the script is bundled into the output and referenced from the index.html.
 *
 * The patch script is equivalent to running:
 * ```js
 * import { DiscordProxy } from '@robojs/patch'
 *
 * DiscordProxy.patch()
 * ```
